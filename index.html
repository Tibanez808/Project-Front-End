                <p class="artificer">Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.
                    <br> <br>
                    Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p>
                <p class="barbarian">A fierce warrior of primitive background who can enter a battle rage <br> <br>
                    When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her
                    place in the world.
                    Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian.
                    Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign?
                    Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?
                    <br> <br>
                    What led you to take up the adventuring life?
                    Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches?
                    Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat?
                    Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee?
                    Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win
                    your freedom.
                    Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you
                    violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.
                </p>
                <p class="bard">An inspiring magician whose power echoes the music of creation <br> <br>
                    Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and
                    motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you
                    had a secure and mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might
                    paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be
                    worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means,
                    including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.
                    <br> <br>
                    Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until
                    you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?
                </p>
                <p class="cleric">A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power <br> <br>
                    As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what
                    principles you want your character to embody. The Gods of the Multiverse section includes lists of
                    many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.
                    <br> <br>
                    Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this
                    service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your
                    wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What
                    are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to
                    prove yourself worthy of a great quest?
                </p>
                <p class="druid">A priest of the Old Faith, wielding the power of nature and adopting animal forms <br> <br>
                    When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.
                    <br> <br>
                    Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.
                </p>
                <p class="fighter">A master of martial combat, skilled with a variety of weapons and armor <br> <br>
                    As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.
                    <br> <br>
                    You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.
                </p>
                <p class="monk">A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and
                    spritual perfection <br> <br>
                    As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?
                    <br> <br>
                    Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?
                    <br> <br>
                    As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.
                </p>
                <p class="paladin">A holy warrior bound to a sacred oath <br> <br>
                    The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? The Gods of the Multiverse section lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.
                    <br> <br>
                    How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.
                    <br><br>
                    As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.
                </p>
                <p class="ranger">A warrior who combats threats on the edges of civilization <br> <br>
                    As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
                    <br> <br>
                    What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?
                </p>
                <p class="rogue">A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies <br> <br>
                    As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?
                    <br> <br>
                    What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.
                </p>
                <p class="sorcerer">A spellcaster who draws on inherent magic from a gift or bloodline <br> <br>
                    The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?
                    <br> <br>
                    How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.
                </p>
                <p class="warlock">A wielder of magic that is derived from a bargain with an extraplanar entity <br> <br>
                    As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?
                    <br> <br>
                    Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.
                    <br> <br>
                    What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?
                    <br> <br>
                    How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.
                    
                </p>
                <p class="wizard">A scholerly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality <br> <br>
                    Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?
                    <br> <br>
                    What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.
